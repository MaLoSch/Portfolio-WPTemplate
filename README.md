# Portfolio-WPTemplate
WordPress Template for online portfolio - malosch.com

ToDo
- Change news feed to Twitter feed
- Change fonttypes so it doesn't look weird in Firefox
- Add filter to Archive (years, design, teaching, fun, reasearch, all)
- Add missing pictures and descriptions
- Add missing projects
- Add plugin list to GitHub
- Add Meta Data to WordPress
- Add back to top button or have menu button always visible

Bugs (descending priority)
- Not working in IE but working in Edge
	- Do I care? No. IE is dead but I should add a notifaction for people using IE.
- Bottom Margin after iFrame > 16 px
- Look for .project_quotes bugs in Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Finetune colors

Wishlist
- Highlight color does slight animation when page is loaded for the first time. Similar to http://jsfiddle.net/5r8BY/
	- Color change according to current time of the day. (Mornings it goes from dark to bright and in the evening vice versa)
- Change the way links are presented. Underline should be colored while the text is black. On mouse-over the text changes to the color and the underline disappears.
	- Use border-bottom: 1px solid #color;
