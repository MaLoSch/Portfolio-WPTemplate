# Portfolio-WPTemplate
WordPress Template for online portfolio - malosch.com

To Do
- Clean up spacing between elements
- Change font types so it doesn't look weird in Firefox
- Add missing pictures and descriptions and filters
- Add missing projects
	- CHI program
	- DIS Website
	- Own Portfolio
- Think about categories (making, electronics, ...)
- Add Meta Data to WordPress

Bugs (descending priority)
- Not working in IE but working in Edge
	- Do I care? No. IE is dead but I should add a notification for people using IE.
- Bottom Margin after iFrame > 16 px
- Look for .project_quotes bugs in Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Fine tune colors

Wish list
- Highlight color does slight animation when page is loaded for the first time. Similar to http://jsfiddle.net/5r8BY/
	- Color change according to current time of the day. (Mornings it goes from dark to bright and in the evening vice versa)
